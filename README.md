# Methods_Spectral_Spatial
This repository contains code for the MAPWAPS Project, where an MSc student investigated methods to improve the accuracy of mapping invasive alien trees. The project focused on evaluating the trade-offs between spectral and spatial resolution when classifying invasive alien trees using four different types of imagery:

1. Aerial Photographs – 3 bands, 0.25 m spatial resolution
2. SPOT 6 – 4 bands, 6 m spatial resolution
3. Sentinel-2 – 13 bands, 10 m spatial resolution
4. EMIT – 285 bands, 60 m spatial resolution

The repository provides the classification code used for each dataset.

A paper based on this work has been submitted for publication:
Skosana, T.E, Rebelo, A.J, & Esler, K.J. (Under review). Exploring the trade-offs between spatial and spectral resolution in mapping invasive alien trees.
